        >You may love your cat, but you may not be fully aware of just how cool
        your she — and her overall species — really is. For example, did you
        know that cats have an extra organ that allows them to taste scents? Or
        that they developed meowing as a way to communicate exclusively with
        humans?</em

      Clearly, there’s more to your little feline friend than meets the eye. So,
      to help you fully appreciate how awesome cats are, we asked cat care
      professionals on Care.com — namely, cat sitters, boarders, and groomers —
      to share their favorite fun facts about these mystical creatures. We then
      pulled together a list of the 101 most amusing cat facts that you can
      share with your friends and family.

        A house cat’s genome is 95.6 percent tiger, and they share many
        behaviors with their jungle ancestors, says Layla Morgan Wilde, a cat
        behavior expert and the founder of Cat Wisdom 101. These behaviors
        include scent marking by scratching, prey play, prey stalking, pouncing,
        chinning, and urine marking.

        Cats are believed to be the only mammals who don’t taste sweetness.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cats are nearsighted, but their peripheral vision and night vision are
        much better than that of humans.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cats are supposed to have 18 toes (five toes on each front paw; four
        toes on each back paw).
      </li>
      <li>Cats can jump up to six times their length.</li>
      <li>
        Cats’ claws all curve downward, which means that they can’t climb down
        trees head-first. Instead, they have to back down the trunk.
      </li>
      <li>Cats have whiskers on the backs of their front legs, as well.</li>
